## Mathematical Foundation

The framework demonstrates the emergence of physics from pure mathematics:

```math
# Geometric Structures
ω = ∑ dpi ∧ dqi                    # Symplectic form
{f,g} = ω(Xf, Xg)                  # Poisson bracket
L ⊂ (M,ω) : ω|L = 0               # Lagrangian submanifold

# Physical Laws (Derived)
δS = 0                             # Action principle
dF = 0, d*F = J                    # Maxwell equations
Gμν = 8πGTμν                       # Einstein equations
```
